# Hangman
A terminal version game of 'Hangman'.

## How to Play
Clone the depository on your machine, using `git clone https://github.com/derbergfex/hangman`.
Use the `cd <the directory to move to>` command to navigate to the space you have cloned the repository in, and type `ruby lib/hangman.rb'.
You'll then be presented with the main game menu: you have the choice to either start a new game or load a saved game.
